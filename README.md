# Rain_Prediction_using_ML

This project aims to predict will the rain occurs next day or not based on existing datasets using three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost. Additionally, AutoML techniques are employed using PyCaret to optimize and compare the performance of various models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
